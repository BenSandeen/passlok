<p>1. Check that the item is in the main box.</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>(...)</strong> button in order to reveal the button dealing with email, which is above the text box.</p>
<p>3. Click the <strong>Mail</strong> button. If so configured in the device, a window appears containing the item and some explanatory text. You only need to supply the recipient's email address and a subject line before clicking the Send button. If you do not want any explanatory text, check the No tags checkbox in the main screen before clicking (...).</p>
<p>4. This only works for sending messages, not for receiving them. If you receive a PassLok-locked message, you must copy it into the clipboard and then paste it into the main box of PassLok, so it can be unlocked. Be also aware that webmail services, such as Gmail, limit the length of messages that can be composed this way. If you get an error from the mail host, you can always copy the box and paste it into a normal mail compose screen.</p>

<div id="c3" class="texter">
  <p>1. Make sure the main box is empty, and then click the <strong>(...)</strong> button.</p>
  <p>2. The item should remain in the box as the buttons around it change. Then click the <strong>Split/Join</strong> button.</p>
  <p>3. A popup asks for the number of parts required to retrieve the original. Write the number, which must be between 2 and 255, and click <strong>OK</strong>. The parts appear in the main box and a message confirms it. If you need more parts (the number required won't change), click <strong>Split/Join</strong> again for each additional part. Copy the parts one by one and send/store them as needed. It is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. PassLok will do this automatically if the No tags checkbox is checked prior to locking. It is also okay to split the parts with spaces and punctuation other than = + / or line returns.</p>

  <p>1. Paste a sufficient number of parts on separate lines of the main box. Make sure that each part is unique. You need as many parts as the number entered when the Key was split, which is written at the end of each PL**p tag. Having more parts than the minimum is OK, so long as they belong to the same set and are not corrupt. They don't need to be placed in any particular order.</p>
  <p>2. Click the <strong>(...)</strong> button, and then the  <strong>Split/Join</strong> button. If all goes well, the reconstructed item appears in the box, otherwise nothing happens. Likely problems include: insufficient number of parts, incomplete or corrupt parts, parts belonging to different sets.</p>

<p>1. Check that the item to be converted into fake text is in the main box. Then click the <strong>(...)</strong> button.</p>
<p>2. If you wish to make fake text that is not English, you will have to change the cover text using the process described in the next item.</p>
<p>3. The <strong>Words</strong> button replaces each character of the text with a word from the cover text; the recipient of the message thus encoded must have the same cover text. The <strong>Spaces</strong> button encodes the text into the spaces of the cover text; the recipient does not need to have the original cover text, but it takes seven times more words than the other mode. When you click either button, the contents of the box are converted into fake text using the current cover, replacing the previous contents.</p>
<p>4. You can now email the fake text, which to an email scanner will be nearly indistinguishable from real text. You can change the punctuation and merge or split lines without changing the encoded material. If you used Spaces encoding, you should be careful not to add or delete any spaces within the encoded text, but it is OK to add more text to complete the last sentence, which may contain additional spaces.</p>

<p>2. If the fake text was encoded with the Words method, you will first have to load the cover text used to do the encoding, using the process described in the next item.</p>
<p>3. Now click either the <strong>Words</strong> button or the <strong>Spaces</strong> button, it doesn't matter which. If successful, the fake text in the box is converted back into the original item and displayed in the box, replacing the fake text.</p>

<h3>Display or change the cover text used for fake text</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="c7" class="texter">
<p>To display the current cover text (which is the default cover text after reloading PassLok), click the <strong>(...)</strong> button, and then the <strong>Cover </strong>button with the box empty.</p>
<p>To change the cover text (this is necessary to make fake text in a language that is not English):</p>
<p>1. Copy a sufficiently long text (must have at least 70 different words) and paste it into the box.</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>(...)</strong> button, and then the <strong>Cover</strong> button.</p>
<p>3. If the change is successful, the box goes blank. If the change is unsuccessful, a message above the box will say why. Typically, failure to change the cover text is due to not having a sufficient number of different words. Use a longer text and try again.</p>
<p>4. The recipient of your messages turned into fake text must have the same cover text in order to retrieve a text encoded with the<strong> Words</strong> method. One way to ensure this when using a non-English language is to display the default cover text, copy it into a translation utility such as Google Translate, and then use the translation as the new cover text.</p>
<p>5. Since the cover text is a (weak) sort of password for a Words-encoded item, it may be good to put special cover texts in permanent storage. To do this, go to the <strong>Locks</strong> screen , write a new name in the small box, then paste the cover text in the large box, and click Save. The cover text can be retrieved like any other stored item, and it will be automatically loaded if displayed on the Locks screen.</p>

  <p>1. Click the <strong>(...)</strong> button, and then the button at the bottom of the screen. Different browsers put different labels on it, such as <strong>"Browse"</strong>, <strong>"Choose File"</strong>, and so forth.</p>
  <p>2. A dialog will appear so you can navigate to the file. Mobile devices, unless they are jailbroken or rooted, restrict the selection to images stored on the device or acquired with the built-in camera. Be aware that pictures taken by the camera are usually too large for PassLok to handle. If all goes well, the file or image loads into the box as a (long) piece of gibberish text, with some identifying information at the top.</p>
  <p>3. Now you can lock it, sign it, or split it like a regular piece of text. The process to retrieve the original file is explained in the item below.</p>

  <p>2. Click the <strong>Show</strong> button at the bottom of the screen. What happens next depends on the browser. Chrome and Firefox will save the file, using the original name if not already taken by another file, into the default location for downloads. Safari does the same, but gives it a generic name that you will have to edit later. Internet Explorer doesn't do anything. Mobile browsers normally open another tab displaying the file contents (if the file type is recognized), from where one can send it to another app.</p>

<p>2. A new screen appears to load the image where the text is to be hidden. To do so, click the <strong>"Choose File"</strong> or <strong>"Browse"</strong> button (browsers vary on the name). A dialog will appear, where you can choose the imag. Bear in mind that images taken with a mobile camera are usually too large for PassLok to be able to use them for hiding items, because of the processing required.</p>
    <p>3. When you see the image, click the <strong>Hide</strong> button. Processing will start, and a message will say when it is completed. At this point, you can right-click (or tap-hold, on mobile devices) and another dialog will offer to save the image. This image now contains the item from the main box, even though it looks the same as before.</p>

<h3>Verify PassLok's integrity</h3>
</div>
<div id="c12" class="texter">
<p>If you got PassLok from the Apple or Google Play stores, you are trusting them with making sure the code is authentic. The following is to check the integrity of an html version of PassLok (does not work on mobile). As usual, be aware that if someone has managed to tamper with the PassLok code, he/she/it could just as easily have tampered with the instructions below and the code at the end. Therefore, it is even safer to get the verification instructions from a different source, such as the PassLok information website at <a href="http://passlok.weebly.com" target="_blank">http://passlok.weebly.com</a></p>
<p>1. Load PassLok from one of the authorized sources listed by the button below, or from storage (local or cloud) if previously saved as html as described in step 3b.</p>
<p>2. Direct your browser to "view source". Each
  browser does this differently, but most non-mobile browsers have this capability. Typically, you load the source on a separate tab by typing CTRL-u (Windows) or option-cmd-u (OSX). On
  the page displaying the source, select all (CTRL-a or cmd-a), then copy to clipboard (CTRL-c or cmd-c). Alternatively, you can get the source from PassLok's GitHub repository at: <a href="https://github.com/fruiz500/passlok" target="_blank">https://github.com/fruiz500/passlok</a>. <strong>DO NOT save the code using the "save" command from the browser menu</strong>, since this command modifies the source code before saving it. A copy of PassLok saved this way will still run, but its SHA256 will be different. If your operating system is Windows, do not use the built-in Notepad program, since it cannot save text with the appropriate encoding. Be sure there are no extra spaces at top and bottom, since this would affect the result.</p>
<p>3. Now you have to take the SHA256 of the code on the clipboard using a program different from PassLok. You have several options:</p>
  <p>a. Use an online utility, where you paste the text on a box and click a button. You must make sure that pasting did not add extra space at the top of the file, which would affect the result. The one at Xorbin (http://www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator) has worked quite well in our tests.</p>
  <p>b. Save the clipboard to a text file, and then use a local program or utility to take the SHA256 of the file (built into the OS in Linux and OSX, not so in Windows). In order to save to file, you will need to start a new file in a good text editor and paste the clipboard there. Then obtain the SHA256 of this file using the local program.</p>
  <p>c. PassLok does have the ability to save anything contained in the box of the extra functions screen to a text file by clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button, as well as to take the SHA256 of the box contents (displayed on the line above), but be aware of the danger that these functions might have been tampered with.</p>
<p>4. Look up the SHA256 for this version of PassLok, written below. If this value and the one obtained in step 3 are the
  same, the program has not been tampered with. Now, a hacker who could tamper with the source code at the server could also change the ID so it matches the tampered code. To make sure that the value is authentic you should watch the one-minute video where the author or PassLok, Francisco Ruiz, reads that string aloud. A link to the video is  also below.</p>
