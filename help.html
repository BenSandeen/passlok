<h3>Click this for our Privacy Statement</h3>

<div id="a23" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p>PassLok provides excellent security, since it is a self-contained piece of code that does not rely on a server for its functionality. Therefore:</p>
<p><strong>1. We'll never give your secret Key to anyone.</strong> We cannot do anything concerning your Key because we just don't have it.</p>
<p><strong>2. We'll never give you or anyone else a conterfeit Lock made from any Key</strong>. We just don't run key servers. PassLok has functions to help you to authenticate Locks, but this is still your responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>3. We'll never weaken the cryptography methods contained within PassLok at the request of a third party, private or public.</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We'd rather shut down our page servers than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of PassLok.</p>
<p>Since PassLok is a piece of human-readable writing, we consider it an expression of free speech, protected by the laws of many countries. Tampering with it in unauthorized ways will violate free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<p>The biggest vulnerability of PassLok is how easy it is to view, <strong>and consequently modify</strong> the code. As mentioned above, we will never weaken the underlying cryptography, but others might. Even though we are taking pains to ensure that PassLok is delivered to you in the most secure way compatible with our budget, <strong>you should still make sure that you have obtained the genuine code.</strong></p>
<p>The method described in the next item is less than perfect but it works in most situations. Once you are sure that your copy of PassLok is pristine, you can save it and run it as many times as you want from its storage location without having to connect to the page server again.</p>

<p>1. Load PassLok from the Web, or from storage (local or cloud) if previously saved as html as described in step 4 below.</p>
<p>2. Direct your browser to &quot;view source&quot;. Each
  browser does this differently, but most non-mobile browsers have this capability. Typically, you load the source on a separate tab by typing CTRL-u (Windows) or option-cmd-u (OSX). On
  the page displaying the source, select all (CTRL-a or cmd-a), then copy to clipboard (CTRL-c or cmd-c). Alternatively, you can get the source from PassLok's GitHub repository at: <a href="https://github.com/fruiz500/passlok">https://github.com/fruiz500/passlok</a></p>
<p>3. Back in the PassLok page, make sure box 2 is clear, then paste the clipboard into it (CTRL-v or cmd-v). Click the ID
  button. The self-ID will be displayed in box 2, replacing the previous contents.</p>
<p>4. For better security, you can do a SHA256 of the source code using an external program or online utility. In this case you may need to paste the clipboard into a text or html editor so you can save it as a file (html or txt). <strong>DO NOT save the code using the "save" command from the browser menu</strong>, since this command tends to modify the source page before it saves it. A copy of PassLok saved this way will still run, but its SHA256 will be different. If your operating system is Windows, do not use the built-in Notepad program, since it cannot save text with the appropriate encoding (UTF-8, no BOM). Be sure there are no extra spaces at top and bottom, since this would affect the result. Then obtain the SHA256 of this file using the external utility.</p>
<p>5. Come back to this Help page and look at the ID for this version of PassLok, shown below. If this ID and the one obtained in step 3 or 4 are the
same, the program has not been tampered with.</p>

<h3>Make a strong Key</h3>
</div>
	<div id="a7" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p>1. Start typing in box 1. As you type, a text below box 1 will tell you
  how strong the Key is, based on simple rules. If you want to see what you
  are typing and don't mind people peering over your shoulder, check the
  Show checkbox.</p>
<p>2. The Key will be stronger if it contains <strong>caPiTals</strong> in unusual places,
  <strong>numb3rs</strong>, and <strong>$ymbol$</strong>. If you use common words, <strong>mispelll</strong> them to make harder a "dictionary attack." Avoid things that refer to yourself and your family, such
  as birthdays or nicknames, or anything else that might be easy to guess,
  like: asdfg, qwerty, password, PassLok, and the like. It is a good practice to <strong>append
  your email address</strong> at the end of the Key, to combat the "rainbow table" attack. The strength meter won't give a Perfect rating unless you do so. Alternatively, you can use anything that is not a standard dictionary word instead of your email, but you must remember it.</p>
<p>3. Bear in mind, however, that you should be able to <strong>remember
  your Key</strong> without having to write it down. PassLok will never
  ask you to change your Key, so this is your chance to make a truly strong Key
  that you will use for a long time.</p>

<p>2. Write or paste the text with its signature appended at the end in box 2. It is okay if 
  the signature is broken up by spaces and special characters other than = + or / or is missing
  its tags up to the &quot;=&quot, but it should not be broken by carriage returns.
  Then click the signature/Verify button. A popup message will say whether
  or not the signature for that text has been verified.</p>

<h3>Lock a second, undetectable message in addition to the main message
  (Decoy mode)</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a12" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p>1. Check the Decoy mode checkbox below box 2.</p>
<p>2. Follow the instructions for any of the three types of locking, using
  a shared Key, the recipient's Lock, or a popup
  Short Message Key. This also works when making a signature. If Decoy mode is checked, a popup will ask for a Decoy Password
  to lock the hidden message.</p>
<p>3. Write or paste into the popup box the Password for the hidden message
  and click OK. It is all right to enter nothing in this box, and in this
  case the hidden message can be retrieved without a Password.</p>
<p>4. A second popup will ask for the hidden message itself. Its length is limited to
  152 ASCII characters in key-locked and signed modes, 87 characters in
  regular locked mode, 38 characters in short message mode, 40 characters in signatures. Non-ASCII characters
  use 6 spaces each, so avoid them if you can. Any text beyond the limit
  will be lost.</p>
<p>5. After clicking OK, the locked
  message containing both the main text and the hidden text will appear in
  box 2, replacing the original text. If it is a signature, it will be appended to the text. Copy it and paste it into your
  communications program. As with regular locked messages, it is okay to
  strip the tags up to the &quot;=&quot; sign, but not recommended. It is also okay to
  split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and punctuation other
  than = + or /</p>

<p>2. Make sure that box 2 is empty, and then click the Split/Join button.</p>
<p>3. A popup asks for the number of parts required to retrieve the original. Write the number, which must be between 2 and 255, and click OK. The parts appear in box 2. If you need more parts (the number required won't change), click Split/Join again for each additional part. Copy the parts one by one and send/store them as needed.

Having more parts than the minimum is OK, so long as they belong to the same set and are not corrupt. They don't need to be placed in any particular order.</p>
<p>2. Click the Split/Join button. If all goes well, the reconstructed Key appears in box 1, otherwise nothing happens. Likely problems include: insufficient number of parts, incomplete or corrupt parts, parts belonging to different sets.</p>

<h2>PassLok in one minute</h2>
</div>
<div id="a17" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p>PassLok is a privacy app conceived under the following principles:</p>
<p>1. Absolutely nothing should be installed or even written in the device. Users should be able to use a public computer or borrow someone else's smartphone, and leave no traces behind.</p>
<p>2. Completely self-contained so it runs offline. No servers.</p>
<p>3. Highest-level security at every step. No compromises.</p>
<p>4. Easy to understand and use by novices. Single-screen graphical interface, as clean and simple as possible. No cryptographic jargon.</p>
    <p>The metaphor underneath PassLok is that of locks: if you want something to be accessible only to certain people, you put a lock on it. PassLok allows you to put a lock on information in the form of text, so that when it is locked it appears to be gibberish. It also allows you to unlock it and return it to its original readable form.</p>
    <p>There are two kinds of locks out there: combination locks, and regular key locks. A combination lock can be opened by those who know the special code or combination. A regular key lock can be closed by anybody, but you need the key that matches the lock in order to open it. PassLok understands both kinds.</p>
    <p>You can lock a text with a combination, which we will call from now on a <strong>shared Key</strong>, which you give to those who are supposed to open the text, but keep secret from those whom you don&rsquo;t want to be able to read it. To do this, place the <strong>shared Key in box 1</strong> of the PassLok page and the <strong>text in box 2</strong>. Then click <strong>Lock/Unlock</strong>. To unlock a locked text, place it in box 2 and the shared Key in box 1, then click Lock/Unlock.</p>
    <p>You can also lock a text with <strong>somebody&rsquo;s Lock</strong>, which you have gotten from that person (more on this below), and then only that person will be able to open it, using his/her secret Key. To lock a text this way, place the <strong>person&rsquo;s Lock in box 1</strong> and the <strong>text in box 2</strong>. Then click <strong>Lock/Unlock</strong>. To unlock a text locked in this way, the recipient will need to place his/her Key in box 1, the locked text in box 2, and then click Lock/Unlock.</p>
<p>Combinations and Keys are secret items, but Locks are not. In PassLok, you start with a Key and then you make the Lock to match your Key. To do this, you place the <strong>Key in box 1</strong> and then click <strong>Lock/Unlock</strong> with box 2 empty. The Lock appears in box 2. <strong>You should give your Lock to people</strong> whom you wish to send you locked messages, as you would give them your phone number or your email address. It is prety much impossible to retrieve the Key from the Lock. For convenience, there is an Email button, so that you only need to supply the addresses where the Lock should be sent.</p>
  <p>PassLok has two more locking modes, which are described below, along with signatures, hidden messages, and secret sharing. Read on if you want to learn about those.</p></div>
  <hr style="background-color: rgb(192, 192, 192); color: #000000;">

  <h2>PassLok lesson 2</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="a18" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p> In PassLok, a Key is like a
      password that you type. The algorithms used in PassLok are the strongest
      known at this time (256-bit AES for encryption, and the 521-bit NIST elliptic curve for public key functions), so this means that <strong>the weak link in the
        chain is your personal or shared Key</strong>. PassLok helps you to make
      a strong Key but does not force you to compose it in any
      particular way so you can actually <strong>remember it without having to write it
      down</strong> anywhere. If you want a more sophisticated indicator of how
	  good your Key is, you may want to spend some time with <a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/" target="_blank">ZXCVBN</a>.</p>
<p>Hackers will try to guess the Key, and you will make their
      work easier if you choose common words and/or numbers that are associated
      with you (such as a birthday, etc.) or are easy to guess for some reason.
      Using capitals in addition to small letters (not just the initial letter)
      forces them to try any combination of both types, which multiplies their
      work. Their work is also increased manifold if you throw in stuff that is
      not letters: numbers, punctuation signs, special characters. Then they'll
      have to guess from a much larger pool of possible keys. A final touch is
      using words that are misspelled, so it's hard to find them in a
      dictionary. For extra security against "rainbow tables," add your email at the end.
      PassLok rewards those using strong passwords by reducing the processing time required to use them.</p>
<p>You can make a <strong>random Key</strong> and its matching Lock by clicking the Make Lock button with box 1 empty. Random Keys are especially useful as temporary Keys for a session where forward secrecy is desired. Random Keys offer perfect security against hackers but they are very hard to remember; resist the temptation to write down a whole Key in a place where it might be compromised. To help with this, PassLok can <strong>split a Key</strong> into several parts, by clicking the Split/Join button. A predetermined number of parts must be entered in box 2 in order to retrieve the original Key, by clicking again the same button. One use of this function is for storing Key parts in different locations, to minimize the risk of compromise.</p>
<p>In addition to key-locking and regular locking, PassLok
      has a <strong>third locking mode</strong>,
      triggered when neither Key nor Lock is supplied in box 1 prior to clicking the Lock/Unlock
      button. In this case, PassLok asks for a Password that is to be the same
      to lock and unlock, as in key-locking. The difference is that the
      locked message is guaranteed to fit within the 160 character limit of a
      cellular text message.</p>      
    <p>PassLok can also put a <strong>personal signature</strong> on a text written
      in box 2, by supplying a personal Key in box 1 and clicking the signature/Verify/ID
      button. The signature, which should be sent along with the plain text, will
      be appended at the end of the text. To verify a signature, people will place the text that
      allegedly was signed, including the signature at the end, into box 2, and the signer's Lock
      (matching the key used for signing) in box 1, then click signature/Verify. A popup
      will say whether or not the signature verification has succeeded.</p>
<p>It is possible to <strong>authenticate a locked message without signing it</strong>. To do this,
lock it with the shared Key that results from merging your personal Key and the recipient's
Lock. Just put your Key in box 1 and the Lock in box 2, then click Make Lock, 
and then write the message into box 2 amd click Lock/Unlock or Email. The recipient will place
 his/her Key in box 1 and your Lock in box 2
in order to retrieve the shared Key, prior to placing the locked message in box 2.
<p>Finally, PassLok is able to hide a second, <strong>undetectable message</strong>
      in all the four types of locked message, plus signatures. This could come in handy in the
      event that someone is forced to turn in his/her secret Key. To enable
      this, click on the Decoy mode checkbox below box 2. Locking,
      unlocking, and signature verification are the same as in the regular mode, except that popups appear requesting first
      the Password to lock the hidden message (an empty Password is okay), and then the hidden
      message itself. </p></div>
