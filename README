README for PassLok Github page

PassLok is a privacy app that implements public key cryptography functions on a browser.

These are the principles guiding the design of PassLok:o	Perfect portability. Runs on any computer or mobile device.o	Completely self-contained so it runs offline. No servers.o	Absolutely nothing should be installed or even written in the device.o	Highest-level security at every step. No compromises.o	Easy to understand and use by novices. Graphical interface,
	as clean and simple as possible. No cryptographic jargon.

Because of this, version 1 of PassLok is pure html code consisting mostly of javascript instructions. Its cryptography code is based on the SJCL code, also on Github. It uses AES for symmetric encryption and elliptic curves (NIST-521 curve) for the public-key functions.

PassLok was started as URSA, also by F. Ruiz, and developed privately up to version 1.3.03, made on 8/15/13. Commits on Github begin seriously with this version.
