    <p>Self-check ID (SHA256):</p>
    9d04-0502-41ff-13cb-3f48-9cb0-af11-e0ef-6c1e-1a05-f8ab-9dae-d45b-4dbf-24a9-aa4b<br />
    <h2><br />
      If you don't know how to begin...</h2>
    <p>PassLok is all about securing text so that only people having the
      appropriate access can read it. It does so by putting a lock on the text
      so it becomes unreadable and can be transmitted securely by insecure
      channels such as email or cellular text messaging. To be able to read it,
      people need to have the key matching the lock or the combination that
      opens it.</p>
    <p>Locking a text with a combination cannot be easier. Just <strong>write
        the text in box 3</strong> of PassLok and the <strong>combination in
        box 1</strong>, then click the <strong>Lock</strong> button. A bunch of
      gibberish, which actually contains the original message locked inside,
      will appear in box 4. To unlock a combination-locked message, you place
      the <strong>locked message</strong><strong> in box 4</strong>, write the
      <strong>combination </strong><strong>in box 1</strong>, and click <strong>Unlock</strong>.
      If the combination is correct, the unlocked plain text will appear in box
      3.</p>
    <p>But the combination method requires both the sender and the recipient to
      possess the combination beforehand. This may be impossible to do securely
      if sender and recipient start out <strong>not having a secret</strong>
      between them. This is where the other kind of lock comes in handy, the one
      that has a key. The <strong>sender put</strong><strong>s the recipient's
        lock on the text,</strong> turning it into apparent gibberish, and then
      the <strong>recip</strong><strong>ient</strong><strong> removes the lock
        using his/her key to that lock</strong>. Thus, <strong>locks are
        distributed publicly</strong> so that people can lock messages intended
      for a particular person, while <strong>keys are kept secret</strong> by
      their owners and never revealed to anyone else.</p>
    <p>So the first step in this process is for each person to select a secret
      key, and then produce its matching lock. In PassLok, a key is like a
      password that you type. The algorithms used in PassLok are the strongest
      known at this time (2013). This means that <strong>the weak link in the
        chain is your personal key</strong>. The same thing could be said of the
      combination, when that type of locking is used. PassLok helps you to make
      a strong key or combination but does not force you to compose it in any
      particular way so you can actually remember it without having to write it
      down anywhere. Hackers will try to guess your key, and you will make their
      work easier if you choose common words and/or numbers that are associated
      with you (such as a birthday, etc.) or are easy to guess for some reason.
      Using capitals in addition to small letters (not just the initial letter)
      forces them to try any combination of both types, which multiplies their
      work. Their work is also increased manifold if you throw in stuff that is
      not letters: numbers, punctuation signs, special characters. Then they'll
      have to guess from a much larger pool of possible keys. A final touch is
      using words that are misspelled, so it's hard to find them in a
      dictionary.</p>
    <p>After you are satisfied with your secret key, make sure it is written in
      box 1 of PassLok and click the Make Lock button. The matching lock will
      appear in box 2. It is a string of 87 random-looking letters and numbers,
      preceded and followed by tags like this: PL**lok, where ** is the version
      number. People are going to need this key to send you locked messages, so
      <strong>you should make it public</strong>. You can publicize it whichever
      way you want: email, Tweeter, SMS, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, whatever.
      Think of it as an unlisted phone number, which you make available to
      people you wish to call you back.</p>
    <p>In addition to combination locking and regular anonymous locking, PassLok
      can sign a message as it locks it, if you supply both the recipient's lock
      and your own secret key. To unlock a signed message, the recipient must
      supply both his/her own secret key and the sender's lock. This way the
      recipient knows who locked the message. There is a fourth locking mode,
      triggered when neither key nor lock is supplied prior to clicking the Lock
      button. In this case, PassLok asks for a password that is to be the same
      to lock and unlock, as in a combination lock. The difference is that the
      locked message is guaranteed to fit within the 160 character limit of a
      cellular text message.</p>
    <p>This is a simple schematic of the different modes available in PassLok,
      and how to trigger each one. For unlocking, PassLok will tell you which
      items to supply if you haven't written them in before clicking Unlock. </p>
    <table border="1" style="width: 639px; height: 123px;">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td width="193"> </td>
          <td width="199"><strong>key/combination present </strong></td>
          <td width="214"><strong>no key/combination </strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>lock present</strong> </td>
          <td>locked and signed (mss)</td>
          <td>anonymous lock (msa) </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>no lock</strong></td>
          <td>combination lock (msc) </td>
          <td>short message mode (no tags) </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>PassLok can also put a <strong>personal stamp</strong> on a text written
      in box 3, by supplying a personal key in box 1 and clicking the Stamp
      button. The stamp, which should be sent along with the plain text, will
      appear in box 4. To verify a stamp, others will place the text that
      allegedly was signed in box 3, the stamp in box 4, and the signer's lock
      (matching the key used for stamping) in box 2, then click Verify. A popup
      will say whether or not the stamp verification has succeeded.</p>
    <p>Finally, PassLok is able to hide a second, <strong>undetectable message</strong>
      in all the four types of locked message. This could come in handy in the
      event that someone is forced to turn in his/her secret key. To enable
      this, click on the "Decoy mode" checkbox below box 4. Locking and
      unlocking are the same as in the regular modes, except that the hidden
      message is to be written in box 4, which is where it will reappear upon
      successful unlocking. PassLok will ask you for the Decoy password (for the
      hidden message) when it needs it. </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>More instructions on how to use PassLok</h2>
    <p>PassLok itself contains some instructions on how to use each box, visible
      by clicking on each of the titles, including the version number at the
      bottom. Here I show instructions on how to use PassLok for different
      scenarios. In all that follows, the boxes are identified by number: 1
      Key/Combination (yellow), 2 Lock (green), 3 Plain Text (yellow), 4 Locked
      Text (green). Yellow boxes contain confidential or secret information,
      with one exception that is duly noted below. Green boxes contain material
      that can be made public without compromising security.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>1. Do a self-check of PassLok</h3>
    <p>1. Load PassLok from the Web or from storage (local or cloud).</p>
    <p>2. Click on Instructions near the top of the page. This page that you are
      reading right now appears in a different tab. The self-ID of the current
      version of PassLok is listed at the top. </p>
    <p>3. Back in the PassLok app, direct your browser to "view source". Each
      browser does this differently, but most of them have this capability. On
      the page displaying the source, select all (CTRL-A or cmd-A, in most
      computers), then copy to clipboard (CTRL-C or cmd-C).</p>
    <p>4. Back in the PassLok page, make sure box 2 is clear, then click on it
      and paste the clipboard (CTRL-V or cmd-V) into box 2. Click the Show ID
      button. The self-ID will be displayed in box 3 for convenience, though
      this is not a secret.</p>
    <p>4. Go back to the Instructions page and copy the self-ID, then paste it
      below the ID that was displayed in box 3 of PassLok. If both IDs are the
      same, the program has not been tampered with.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <h3>2. Make a strong Key or Combination</h3>
    <p>1. Start typing in box 1. As you type, a text below box 1 will tell you
      how strong the key is, based on simple rules. If you want to see what you
      are typing and don't mind people peering over your shoulder, check the
      Show checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. The key will be stronger if it contains caPiTals in unusual places,
      numb3rs, and $ymbol$. If you use common words, mispelll them to make them
      harder to guess. Avoid things that refer to yourself and your family, such
      as birthdays or nicknames, or anything else that might be easy to guess,
      like: asdfg, qwerty, password, PassLok, and the like.</p>
    <p>3. Bear in mind, however, that you should be able to <strong>remember
        your key</strong> without having to write it down. PassLok will never
      ask you to change your key, so this your chance to make a truly strong key
      that you will use for a long time.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <h3>3. Make the Lock that matches a given Key</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste your secret key in box 1. It is masked by default, so
      if you want to display it, check the "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Click the "Make Lock" button. The lock matching that key will appear
      in box 2. It is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, or insert
      spaces, carriage returns, or special characters other than = + or / but
      not recommended. The lock can be made available to anyone who wishes to
      secure messages to be read with the matching key.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>4. Display the ID of a Lock</h3>
    <p>1. Paste the lock in box 2. It is okay if the tags up to the "=" signs
      are missing, or extra spaces, carriage returns, or special characters
      other than = + or / have been added.</p>
    <p>2. Click the "Show ID" button. The unique ID of that lock will be
      displayed in box 3 for convenience, though this is not a secret (this is
      the one exception to the color code). It is useful to verify the
      authenticity of a lock by means of a phone call, video message, etc., in
      which at least one of the parties reads the ID.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>5. Lock a message with a combination, to be unlocked with the same
      combination</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste the combination in box 1. It is masked by default, so
      if you want to display it, check the "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Write or paste the message in box 3. Click the "Lock" button. The
      locked message will appear in box 4. Copy it and paste it into your
      communications program or hit "Send Email" to open your default email. It
      is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. It is
      also okay to split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and
      punctuation other than = + or / This message can only be unlocked by
      someone having the same combination.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>6. Unlock a message locked with a combination (tags are PL**msc)</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste the combination in box 1. It is masked by default, so
      if you want to display it, check the "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Paste the locked message in box 4. It is okay if it is broken up by
      spaces, carriage returns, and special characters other than = + or / or is
      missing its tags. Then click the "Unlock" button. The unlocked message
      will appear in box 3.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>7. Lock a message with a regular lock, to be unlocked with the matching
      key</h3>
    <p>1. Paste the lock in box 2. It is okay if the tags up to the "=" signs
      are missing, or extra spaces, carriage returns, or special characters
      other than = + or / have been added.</p>
    <p>2. Write or paste your message in box 3. Click the "Lock" button. The
      locked message will appear in box 4. Copy it and paste it into your
      communications program or hit "Send Email" to open your default email. It
      is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. It is
      also okay to split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and
      punctuation other than = + or / This message can only be unlocked by
      someone having the secret key matching the lock used to secure it.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>8. Unlock an anonymous locked message with the matching secret key (tags
      are PL**msa)</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste into box 1 the key matching the lock used to secure the
      message. It is masked by default, so if you want to display it, check the
      "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Paste the locked message in box 4. It is okay if it is broken up by
      spaces, carriage returns, and special characters other than = + or / or is
      missing its tags. Then click the "Unlock" button. The unlocked message
      will appear in box 3.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>9. Lock and sign a message with a secret key and the recipient's lock</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste your secret key in box 1. It is masked by default, so
      if you want to display it, check the "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Paste the recipient's lock in box 2. It is okay if the tags up to the
      "=" signs are missing, or extra spaces, carriage returns, or special
      characters other than = + or / have been added.</p>
    <p>3. Write or paste your message in box 3. Click the "Lock" button. The
      locked message will appear in box 4. Copy it and paste it into your
      communications program or hit "Send Email" to open your default email. It
      is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. It is
      also okay to split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and
      punctuation other than = + or / This message can only be unlocked by
      someone having the key matching the lock used to secure it, plus the lock
      matching the secret key used to lock it, which is useful to authenticate
      the sender.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>10. Unlock a message that is locked and signed (tags are PL**mss)</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste your key in box 1. It is masked by default, so if you
      want to display it, check the "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Paste the sender's lock in box 2. It is okay if the tags up to the "="
      signs are missing, or extra spaces, carriage returns, or special
      characters other than = + or / have been added.</p>
    <p>3. Paste the locked message in box 4. It is okay if it is broken up by
      spaces, carriage returns, and special characters other than = + or / or is
      missing its tags. Then click the "Unlock" button. The unlocked message
      will appear in box 3.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>11. Make a short locked message suitable for SMS</h3>
    <p>1. Make sure both box 1 and box 2 are empty.</p>
    <p>2. Write or paste your message in box 3. Message length is limited to 57
      ASCII characters. Non-ASCII characters use 6 spaces each, so avoid them if
      you can. Any text beyond the limit will be lost. Hit the "Lock" button.</p>
    <p>3. A popup will ask you for a password, which will be necessary to unlock
      the message. Write it in and click OK. The locked message will appear in
      box 4. Copy it and paste it into your communications program. The locked
      message, which has no tags, will fit within one SMS message (160
      characters). </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>12. Unlock a short locked message (no tags, first character other than !
      @ or #)</h3>
    <p>1. Paste the locked message in box 4. It is okay if it is broken up by
      spaces, carriage returns, and special characters. Then click the "Unlock"
      button.</p>
    <p>2. A popup will ask for the password, which is the same used for locking.
      Write it in and click OK. The unlocked message will appear in box 3.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>13. Stamp a text with a secret key</h3>
    <p>1. Write or paste your secret key in box 1. It is masked by default, so
      if you want to display it, check the "Show" checkbox.</p>
    <p>2. Write or paste the text to be signed in box 3. Click the "Sign"
      button. A stamp matching the text and the key will appear in box 4. Copy
      it and use it as appropriate. It is okay to strip the tags up to the "="
      sign, but not recommended. It is also okay to split the stamp with spaces,
      line returns, and punctuation other than = + or /</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>14. Verify a signature allegedly matching a text</h3>
    <p>1. Paste the lock of the person who made the stamp in box 2. It is okay
      if the tags up to the "=" signs are missing, or extra spaces, carriage
      returns, or special characters other than = + or / have been added.</p>
    <p>2. Write or paste the text that was stamped in box 3. It is okay if the
      spaces and carriage returns within the text are different from those of
      the original text that was signed.</p>
    <p>3. Paste the stamp in box 4. It is okay if it is broken up by spaces,
      carriage returns, and special characters other than = + or / or is missing
      its tags. Then click the "Verify" button. A popup message will say whether
      or not the stamp for that text has been verified.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <h3>15. Lock a second, undetectable message in addition to the main message
      (decoy mode)</h3>
    <p>1. Check the "Decoy mode" checkbox below box 4.</p>
    <p>3. Write or type your hidden message in box 4. Its length is limited to
      152 ASCII characters in combination and signed modes, 87 characters in
      anonymous mode, 38 characters in short message mode. Non-ASCII characters
      use 6 spaces each, so avoid them if you can. Any text beyond the limit
      will be lost. </p>
    <p>2. Follow the instructions for any of the four types of locking, using
      only a combination, only a lock, both a key and a lock, or a popup
      password. If decoy mode is checked, a popup will ask for a decoy password
      to lock the hidden message.</p>
    <p>3. Write or paste into the popup box the password for the hidden message
      and click "OK". It is all right to enter nothing in this box, and in this
      case the hidden message can be retrieved without a password. An locked
      message containing both the main text and the hidden text will appear in
      box 4, replacing the hidden text. Copy it and paste it into your
      communications program. As with regular locked messages, it is okay to
      strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. It is also okay to
      split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and punctuation other
      than = + or / </p>
    <h3> </h3>
    <h3>16. Reveal the hidden text contained within a message locked in decoy
      mode</h3>
    <p>1. Check the "Decoy mode" checkbox below box 4.</p>
    <p>2. Follow the instructions for any of the four locking modes, using a
      key, a combination, both a lock and a key, or nothing. If decoy mode is
      checked, a popup will ask for a decoy password.</p>
    <p>3. Write or paste into the popup box the special password for the hidden
      message, if there is one, and hit "OK". The hidden message, if it exists,
      will appear in box 4 even if the main unlocking fails. The main message
      will appear in box 3 if the main unlocking is successful.</p>
