<h3>Add an item (shared Key, Lock, etc.) to PassLok's permanent storage</h3>
  </div>
    <div id="b1" class="texter">
      <p>1. You must have entered your secret Key for any items to be stored. You enter this Key by means of the <strong>myKey</strong> button on the main screen.</p>
      <p>2. Write a name for the item in the little box on top. If the name is already taken, something will appear in the large box below it; if you use that name, the stored item will be replaced rather than added.</p>
      <p>3. Write or paste the item in the large box. It can be anything: somebody's Lock, a shared Key, a cover text, a list (don't write your secret Key here; its proper place is the dialog that opens with the myKey button). Then click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>
      <p>4. If you write nothing in the large box before clicking the <strong>Save</strong> button, PassLok will generate a 86-character base64 string, which will be stored under the name supplied in the small box. This way you can use PassLok to make secure passwords for websites, etc.</p>
      <p>5. A message confirms that the item has been added, and the item itself appears in the box, encrypted with your secret Key.</p>
      <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDNRK4CdW2o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDNRK4CdW2o</a></p>

       <p>2. Start writing the name of the item in the small box. As you type, the line above the box displays existing items matching what you have typed so far, and the encrypted item appears in the large box. You can stop typing once you see the item you're looking for. Search is case-insensitive, so if the item does not appear, that probably means that the name is wrong.</p>
       <p>3. PassLok can use the item in encrypted form, but if you want to see the original, you can type "Enter" after the correct name is displayed, and the item will be decrypted. The item is also decrypted when you click the <strong>Back</strong> button. If the item is a cover text, it loads automatically as new cover text.</p>

      <h3>Find a Lock in PassLok's general directory</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="b5" class="texter">
        <p>Sometimes you may need somebody's Lock and not have it stored anywhere. This is where PassLok's general directory comes in. When you click the <strong>Lock directory</strong> button, a new screen opens up where you can search for a Lock, watch the authenticating video belonging to a Lock, or upload your own Lock. The Locks in this directory are indexed by email address.</p>
        <p>The Lock directory has its own set of help pages, but let us mention here some important things:</p>
        <p>a. The Lock directory is a separate webpage from PassLok, which is indicated by a different color scheme. Normally, you will need to copy and paste material between it and PassLok, but if you have found a Lock it gets copied automatically to the Locks screen so the only thing you may need to do is give it a name and save it.</p>
        <p>b. PassLok makes no guarantee as to the authenticity of the Locks contained in its directory. Email confirmation is required to load or update Locks, but this is not very secure. Since users are encouraged to add authenticating videos and the directory screen has a button especially designed to play them, you should watch the video attached to a Lock before you use it for anything sensitive.</p>
        <p>c. The PassLok directory is meant as a convenience, not as a replacement for your local database. The directory is not available when you are offline (the local database is). You cannot upload anything but Locks to the directory.</p>
        <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UQw7MaK3T8" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UQw7MaK3T8</a></p>

  </div>
  <div id="b6" class="texter">
        <p>1. Click the <strong>All</strong> button below the big box. The complete stored database, including PFS and hidden data, is displayed in the box so you can find items and copy them easily.</p>
        <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_DwcEyaeIQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_DwcEyaeIQ</a></p>

  <h3>Move the entire stored database</h3>
       </div>
 <div id="b7" class="texter">
      <p>1. Click the <strong>Move</strong> button below the big box. The entire database is first locked with the secret Key and placed in the main box. Then a prompt asks you to confirm deleting it from the device. If you click <strong>OK,</strong> the entire stored database is deleted. There is no going back. If you click <strong>Cancel</strong>, the locked backup remains in the main box. This is useful whenever you stop using a device or just want to transfer it to another device, or if the database becomes corrupted.</p>
      <p>2. To retrieve a backed-up database (has PL**db tags), place it in the main box and click <strong>Lck/Un</strong>. If the secret Key has been entered, the database will be unlocked and placed in the Locks screen. Then you can add it to the device's current database by clicking <strong>Merge</strong>.</p>

  </div>
  <div id="b8" class="texter">
       <p>1. Paste the additional data into the big box. The format is the following: name, followed by a colon (:), new line, item data; then two new lines before the next name, and so forth. If a name also has hidden data and PFS data, those follow the item data, occupying consecutive lines.</p>
       <p>2. Click the <strong>Merge</strong> button. The new data is merged into the stored database. Items are added in encrypted form but are notchecked as they are added, so it is possible that different items may need different Keys to be decrypted.</p>

     <h3>Make a List of items</h3>
 </div>
  <div id="b9" class="texter">
      <p>1. You can always make a List of Locks and shared Keys, in order to lock a message for multiple recipients, by writing the Locks or shared Keys in separate lines of the Locks box. PassLok will remember it during the session if you click the <strong>List</strong> button. Adding one or several items is as easy as putting them in the box and clicking<strong> List</strong> again. If you click <strong>List</strong> with the box empty, the current List will be displayed.The current List is deleted by pressing the <strong>Reset</strong> button while the List is displayed.</p>
      <p>1. If you want to store a List permanently, you must write a name for it in the small box, then write the items or re-display them by clicking the<strong> List</strong> button, and then click <strong>Save</strong>. You must have entered your secret Key before the List can be saved. The process for entering this Key is described above.</p>
      <p>2.You can also make a List of items already stored in the database, which can be itself stored. In this case, write the name of the item rather than the item itself. if you don't recall the exact name of an item, start typing it in the little box, and click <strong>List</strong> when the correct item appears; the item name will be added to the current List.</p>

  <h3>Make a random Key</h3>
  </div>
 <div id="b10" class="texter">
      <p>Sometimes you want to make a high-security random Key, which can be used as a shared Key or even as a secret Key. It might be split into several parts for safekeeping, as described in another help screen, or stored in encrypted form, rather than memorized (because you are never going to write it down unencrypted, right?). PassLok has a way to make a 86-character random Key:      </p>
      <p>1. Click <strong>Locks</strong>, and write a name in the small name box if you want to save the random Key. If the name is not in the database, the large box will end up empty.</p>
      <p>2. Then, with the large box empty, click <strong>Save</strong>. An 86-character random Key is made, which is immediately encrypted with the secret Key, if that has been previously entered. From then on this random Key, suitable as a shared Key or high-security password for a login, can be recalled and used by typing its name into the small box. If no name was supplied in the small box, the Key is still generated but it is not saved in the local database.</p>
      <p>3.To make the Lock matching this Key, copy the Key, go back to the main screen, click <strong>myKey</strong>, paste the Key there, and click <strong>Make Lock</strong>. The Lock will appear in the main screen.</p>
      <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gRE1xPr_nE" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gRE1xPr_nE</a></p>

  <h3>Combine a Key and a Lock</h3>
  </div>
 <div id="b11" class="texter">
      <p>This operation, which goes by the technical name of "Diffie-Hellman key exchange" is at the core of many PassLok functions. Should you ever want to compute the result manually, here is how to do it:</p>
      <p>1. Write or paste the Key or the Lock in the main box.</p>
      <p>2. Click <strong>Locks</strong>, and then write or paste the other item in the large box. If the item is in PassLok's permanent storage, you can bring it out by starting to type its name in the small box.</p>
      <p>3. Click the <strong>Merge</strong> button below the large box. The Key and the Lock will merge and the 86-character result is placed in both boxes. If both items or neither of them is a valid Lock, the merging process fails and a message is displayed to inform the user.</p>
      <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0UC61Z2KAA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0UC61Z2KAA</a></p>

  <h3>Make a video to authenticate your Lock</h3>
  </div>
 <div id="b12" class="texter">
      <p>It is highly recommended that you make a video whenever you change your secret Key, so that others can verify that the matching Lock really belongs you. PassLok does not have video functions, but here are a few short instructions on how to do this using a popular online video resource:</p>
      <p>1. When you make your Lock, click the <strong>(...)</strong> button on PassLok so the Lock&rsquo;s ID is displayed above the window. Copy this ID.</p>
      <p>2. Go to a device with a camera and make a video of yourself reading this ID. For better security, have some music playing in the background as you read the ID. For good measure, you may want to show to the camera a piece of paper where you've written the ID.  The video should be about one minute long. Then post the video on a public online service.</p>
      <p>3. When you post your Lock so that people can use it to lock messages for you, post also the address of the video on the line immediately below the Lock, to facilitate the verifying process in step 4.</p>
      <p>4. People wishing to authenticate your Lock can generate the ID as in step 1 (which usually won't be affected by having the video address on the line below), and then they can  click the <strong>Show</strong> button, which will open the accompanying video if the address is written below the Lock itself. Then they will be able to compare it with the ID they see you reading in the video. If they know your face and your voice, they will be assured that the Lock is authentic.</p>
      <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bODBEB6Oo2I" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bODBEB6Oo2I</a></p>

   <div onclick="openClose('b13')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer">
  <h3>Authenticate a Lock without using videos</h3>
  </div>
 <div id="b13" class="texter">
      <p>The easy way: get the ID of the Lock by placing it in the main box and clicking <strong>(...)</strong>. The ID will be displayed at the top. Then you can call the Lock's owner and ask him/her to read the same ID over the phone. But let's say you cannot establish a live conversation. If you are communicating exclusively by email, you can send a person whom you know and who knows you the following message, or something like it:</p>
      <p><br />
        <em>Dear So-and-So:</em><br />
        <em>I just obtained your PassLok Lock from (cite source), but I still wonder if it is authentic since I am unable to view the authenticating video. Therefore, I ask you to help me authenticate it through the interlock protocol. Here's what I want you to do:</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Write me a message asking me to take a picture or video of myself doing something of your choice. Lock it with my Lock, which is at the bottom of this message, but don't send it back to me just yet. Instead, save it and display the locked message's ID, and send me that.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I receive your ID, I will also write a message asking you to do something in a picture or short video, which I'll lock with your Lock. But I'll send you the ID first. When you get it, go ahead and send me the locked message containing your instructions.</em></li>
        <li><em>When I get that, I'll check that the ID matches and then I'll follow your instructions. I'll send you the picture or video right away, unlocked, along with my locked request. Expect to receive it within half an hour of your message.</em></li>
        <li><em>When you get it, please make sure it matches the ID I sent you earlier, and that what I sent conforms to your instructions. If everything is okay, go ahead and follow my instructions and send me the result as soon as possible, unlocked as well, within half an hour if you can. Then I'll know that your Lock is authentic.</em></li>
    </ol>
      <p><em>Many thanks. Sincerely, This-and-That</em></p>
    <p><br />
      Alternatively, you can ask the other person to split the locked message in two, and send you first one half, then the other half (PassLok has a built-in function to split messages securely, explained in another help screen).  The pictures or videos (or recordings) don't need to be locked. Only the instructions for making them need to be locked and transmitted with a two-step process. There is an article in PassLok.com on what makes this protocol work for authenticating Locks.</p>
