    <div id="a1" class="texter">
    <p>Before you do aything else, you may want to watch this short video, which explains the essential concepts in a lighthearted way: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZF3EiDt7Ws" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZF3EiDt7Ws</a></p>
    <p>If you don't have time for the video, here's the two-paragraph version. PassLok locks messages and files, turning them into gibberish so only the intended recipients can return them to their original form and read them. It is based on digital Keys and Locks. A Lock is used to lock a message,  and then only the matching Key can unlock it so it becomes readable again. A Key is a piece of text that you choose and memorize; it is personal and should never be revealed to anyone. You make your Lock from your Key, and then you give it to people so they can lock messages for you to read.  It is impossible to get the Key from its matching Lock. Keys are to be kept secret, but Locks are made to be widely distributed. Locks look like gibberish but have tags at both ends of the form &quot;PL17lok&quot;.</p>
    <p>The first step is to come up with a secret Key that you can remember. You enter it in PassLok by clicking the <strong>myKey</strong> button. Then you make its matching Lock by clicking the <strong>Make Lock</strong> button on that screen. Then you click the <strong>Back</strong> button to go back to the main screen and see your Lock and copy it. You give this Lock to all the people you wish to write to you in secret. They will also send you their Locks, which you can store anywhere you want. To lock a message, the sender puts the plain message in the main box, then clicks <strong>Locks</strong> to get to the Locks screen, and puts the recipient's Lock in the big box there. Going back to the main screen, the message is locked when the sender clicks <strong>Lck/Un</strong> (Lock/Unlock). The recipient unlocks the locked message by first putting it in the main box, then clicks <strong>myKey</strong> and enters his/her secret Key in the small box that appears. Going back to the main screen, the message is unlocked when the recipient clicks <strong>Lck/Un</strong>.</p>
	<p>PassLok is very powerful, combining AES encryption with elliptic curves at the strongest levels defined by standards, and including several ways to hide the result from prying eyes. All processing occurs on your device with no server involved, so your privacy cannot be compromised by third parties. But great power means a lot of buttons.</p>
	<p>Fortunately, only four buttons are essential to get started. They are <span style="color:blue">highlighted in blue:</span></p>
    <p><span style="color:blue"><strong>myKey</strong></span> opens a dialog where you can enter your secret Key, which is needed for most advanced functions in PassLok. It is also needed to unlock messages locked with your personal Lock, which is not secret. To display this Lock, click the <strong>Make Lock</strong> button.</p>
    <p><span style="color:blue"><strong>Make Lock</strong></span> (visible after clicking myKey) creates the Lock matching the Key that has been entered in the Key dialog and writes it on the main screen, from where it can be copied, emailed, etc.</p>
	<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>Locks</strong></span> opens a screen where you can enter the Lock or shared Key that is needed to lock the contents of the main box.</p>
	<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>Lck/Un</strong></span> (abbreviated from Lock/Unlock) locks the plain message in the main box, or unlocks it if it was locked. The appropriate Key or Lock must have been entered previously by means of the <strong>myKey</strong> or <strong>Locks</strong> buttons.</p>
	
	<p>With these four buttons, you can get started locking and unlocking messages with very high security. Here's another video that shows this (made for version 1.6, though): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wrhfzU4DFc" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wrhfzU4DFc</a>    </p></div>

    <div onClick="openClose('a2')" style="cursor:hand; cursor:pointer">
<h3>Save PassLok to my device, so I don't have to download it again</h3>  
</div>
      <div id="a2" class="texter">
<p>PassLok is designed to save its code within the browser, so it only gets downloaded again if the code has changed. Once PassLok has reached your device from its source server, it works even if the device is offline. Just make a bookmark on your browser so you can access it quickly. Still, you can make it behave even more like an app, this way:</p>
<p>1. If you are using a computer, you can direct the Browser to save the code to a local file via the "Save as..." command from the browser menu. Then you can place a link or shortcut to that file on your desktop. Even better than the "Save as..." command is to direct the browser to display the source (Ctrl-U or cmd-ctrl-U does it, on most devices and browsers), and then save the page that appears with the "Save as..." command. This way you'll save the original code rather than the code after it has been interpreted by the browser.</p>
<p>2. From an iOS device, it is as easy as loading PassLok on Safari, and then selecting "Add to Home Screen" from the box and arrow icon at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>3. On Android, the same is typically achieved by first making a bookmark of the PassLok page, then tap-holding on the PassLok bookmark and selecting "Add to Home Screen." On some versions you can also tap-hold on the desktop screen and select "Add to Home Screen" followed by "Shortcut", "Bookmark", and selecting PassLok from the list. Newer versions of Android have still more direct ways to do this.</p>

<h3>Make a strong Key</h3>
</div>
	<div id="a3" class="texter">
<p>1. Click the <strong>myKey</strong> button, then start typing in the box. As you type, a text above the box will tell you
  how strong the Key is, based on simple rules. If you want to see what you
  are typing and don't mind people peering over your shoulder, check the
  Show checkbox.</p>
<p>2. The Key will be stronger if it contains <strong>caPiTals</strong> in unusual places,
  <strong>numb3rs</strong>, and <strong>$ymbol$</strong>. If you use common words, <strong>mispelll</strong> them to make harder a "dictionary attack." Avoid things that refer to yourself and your family, such
  as birthdays or nicknames, or anything else that might be easy to guess,
  like: asdfg, qwerty, password, PassLok, and the like. It is a good practice to <strong>append
  your email address</strong> at the end of the Key, to combat the "rainbow table" attack. Alternatively, you can use anything that is not a standard dictionary word instead of your email.</p>
<p>3. Bear in mind, however, that you should be able to <strong>remember
  your secret Key</strong> without having to write it down. PassLok will never
  ask you to change your Key, so this is your chance to make a truly strong Key
  that you will use for a long time.</p>
  <p>4. PassLok compensates for bad Keys by taking longer to do its computations. If PassLok is slow, this is likely because your Key strength is less than Medium.</p>
  <p>5. If your Key is found in its built-in database of 500 most common Keys, PassLok will refuse to accept it. Just choose another Key.</p>
  <p>All of this is explained in this video tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRiuBd9Co0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRiuBd9Co0</a></p></div>

<h3>Display the Lock that matches your secret Key</h3>
</div>
<div id="a4" class="texter">
<p>1. Write your secret Key in the box that is accessed with the <strong>myKey</strong> button. It is masked by default, so
  if you want to display it, check the Show checkbox.</p>
<p>2. Click the <strong>Make Lock</strong> button. The lock matching that Key will appear
  in the main box, ready to be emailed or sent by SMS. It is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, or insert
  spaces, carriage returns, or special characters other than = + or / but
  not recommended. PassLok will do this automatically if the No tags checkbox is checked prior to locking. 
  The lock can be made available to anyone who wishes to
  secure messages to be read with the matching Key.</p>
<p>3. If you click <strong>Make Lock</strong> a second time, the Lock directory screen will open with the lower box filled with the Lock you just made. If you supply your email, you'll be able to use the buttons on that screen to post it to the directory or check that it has not changed.</p>

   an SMS text message, or posted it publicly. You can tell it is a Lock because it comprises 87 random-looking characters, likely 
   with PL**lok tags at either end (** is the version number). You need this Lock before you can do anything else. It is okay if the tags up to the "=" signs
   are missing, or extra spaces, carriage returns, or special characters
   other than = + or / have been added. If you have previously stored it in your device's Locks directory, you can retrieve it by clicking the <strong>Locks</strong> button and then beginning to type the name associated with the Lock in the top box.</p>
 <p>3. To lock a message so it can be read by several people, place their respective Locks in the box, one per line. If a Lock was previously stored, you can write the name associated with that Lock, instead.</p>
<p>4. Write or paste your message in the main box. Click the <strong>Lck/Un</strong> button. The
  locked message will appear in the main box, replacing the original message. Copy it and paste it into your
  communications program or click (...), followed by Mail to open your default email. 
  It is okay to strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. 
  PassLok will do this automatically if the No tags checkbox is checked prior to locking. It is
  also okay to split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and

Follow the instructions from the Locks <strong>Help</strong> button to do this. Once the item is stored, you can retrieve it by beginning to type its name in the top box of the Locks screen. If you are restarting a PFS conversation that was interrupted, you must first clear the old PFS data for that recipient by clicking the <strong>Reset</strong> button after the recipient's name is displayed.</p>

        <p>6. If Short mode is used, locking cannot be repeated without corrupting the PFS data stored in the device, which will make it impossible for the recipient to unlock the message (unless it is re-locked as a regular length message). Make sure your plain message is what you want before clicking Lck/Un. This restriction does not apply to regular length messages, but you will get a warning alerting you that you are skipping a turn.</p>

<h3>Unlock a short locked message (no tags)</h3>
  </div>
  <div id="a14" class="texter">
<p>1. It does not matter which of the radio buttons below the main box is selected, or whether the Short checkbox is checked, since the locking mode is determined automatically from the locked message itself.</p>
<p>2. Paste the locked message into the main box. It is okay if it is broken up by
  spaces, carriage returns, and special characters. As with regular-length messages, either a shared Key must be entered in the <strong>Locks</strong> box, or the secret Key in its own box, prior to unlocking. 
  Then click the <strong>Lck/Un</strong> button.</p>
<p>3. The unlocked message will appear in the main box, replacing the locked message.</p>

<h3>Sign a text with your secret Key</h3>
</div>
<div id="a15" class="texter">
<p>1. Write your secret Key in the box that is accessed with the <strong>myKey</strong> button. It is masked by default, so if you want to display it, check the Show checkbox.</p>
<p>2. Write or paste the text to be signed in the main box. Click the <strong>Sig/Ver</strong>
  button (abbreviated from Sign/Verify). A signature matching the text and your Key will be appended at the end of the text in the main box. Copy
  it and use it as appropriate. If you click (...) followed by Mail the text with its signature
  will be placed into an email using the default program.
  It is okay to strip the tags up to the "="
  sign, but not recommended. PassLok will do this automatically if the No tags checkbox is checked prior to locking. 
  It is also okay to split the signature with spaces,
  and punctuation other than line returns or = + or /. </p>

<p>1. Paste the Lock of the person who added the signature into the large box that is accessed with the <strong>Locks</strong> button. It is okay
  if the tags up to the "=" signs are missing, or extra spaces, carriage
  returns, or special characters other than = + or / have been added. If you have previously stored it in your device's Locks directory, you can retrieve it by  beginning to type the name associated with the Lock in the top box.</p>
<p>2. Write or paste the text with its signature appended on a separate line at the end, in the main box. It is okay if 
  the signature is broken up by spaces and special characters other than = + or / or is missing
  its tags up to the "=", but it should not be broken by carriage returns.
  Then click the <strong>Sig/Ver</strong> button. A message above the main box will say whether
  or not the signature for that text has been verified.</p>

<h3>Lock a second, undetectable message in addition to the main message

  </div>
  <div id="a17" class="texter">
<p>1. Check the <strong>Decoy</strong> mode checkbox below the main box.</p>
<p>2. Follow the above instructions for any kind of locking, using
  a shared Key or the recipient's Lock, short or regular length, including PFS mode. This also works when adding a signature. If Decoy mode is checked, a popup will ask for a Decoy Password to lock the hidden message, and the hidden message itself.</p>
<p>3. Write or paste into the the corresponding boxes the Password and the hidden message. The length of the hidden message is limited to
  152 ASCII characters in key-locked and signed modes, 87 characters in
  anonymous and PFS modes, 37 characters in Short message mode (key-locked or signed only), 40 characters in signatures. Non-ASCII characters
  use 6 spaces each, so avoid them if you can. Any text beyond the limit will be lost. Then click <strong>OK</strong>. To view the Password before you use it, check the Show checkbox.</p>
<p>4. After clicking <strong>OK</strong>, the locked
  message containing both the main text and the hidden text will appear in
  the main box, replacing the original text. If it is a signature, it will be appended to the text. Copy it and paste it into your
  communications program. As with regular locked messages, it is okay to
  strip the tags up to the "=" sign, but not recommended. It is also okay to
  split the locked message with spaces, line returns, and punctuation other
  than = + / or %</p>

<p>3. Write or paste into the popup box the special Password for the hidden
  message and click <strong>OK</strong>. To view the Password before you use it, check the Show checkbox. The hidden message, if it exists,
  will appear above the main box. In the case of signatures, the hidden message appears in the place normally used by the verification message, so if you still wish to verify the signature, you need to uncheck Decoy Mode and click Sig/Ver again so the verification message is displayed.</p>

    <p>You can start by looking at the help pages that open from the Locks screen (about Locks and Keys) and the extra functions screen (about disguising the output, files, and other neat tricks other than locking/unlocking). If this is not enough for you, here are a couple more sources you may want to check out:</p>
    <p>The PassLok <a href="passlok_manual.pdf" target="_blank">manual in PDF form.</a></p>
    <p>The PassLok informational website at <a href="http://passlok.weebly.com" target="_blank">http://passlok.weebly.com</a>. It contains a number of videos and more PDF documents.</p>

<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
</div>
<div id="a21" class="texter">
<p>PassLok provides excellent security, since it is a self-contained piece of code that does not rely on servers for its functionality. Therefore:</p>
<p><strong>1. We'll never give your secret Key to anyone.</strong> We cannot do anything concerning your secret Key because we just don't have it. PassLok is designed so your secret Key never leaves the device.</p>
<p><strong>2. We'll never give you or anyone else a conterfeit Lock made from any Key</strong>. We just don't run key servers. PassLok has functions to help you to authenticate Locks, but this is still your responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>3. We'll never weaken the cryptography methods contained within PassLok at the request of a third party, private or public.</strong> This also means no backdoors will ever be added. We'd rather shut down the project than be forced to do this, which would betray the very essence of PassLok. If we learn that counterfeit copies are circulating (whether placed by hackers or government agencies), we'll make the fact known to users.</p>
<p>Since the html version of PassLok is a piece of human-readable writing, we consider it an expression of free speech protected by the laws of many countries. Putting into circulation tampered versions of it violates free speech and copyright protection laws.</p>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<p>The biggest vulnerability of PassLok is how easy it is to view, <strong>and consequently modify</strong> the html code. As mentioned above, we will never weaken the underlying cryptography, but others might. Even though we are taking pains to ensure that PassLok is delivered to you in the most secure way compatible with our budget, <strong>you should still make sure that you have obtained the genuine code.</strong></p>
<p>The method described in the other help screen, to verify the integrity of PassLok in html form, is less than perfect but it works in most situations. Once you are sure that your copy of PassLok is pristine, you can save it and run it as many times as you want from its storage location without having to connect to the page server again.</p>
<p>PassLok contains strong cryptographic methods, which may be illegal to use in some countries. Please check the local laws before using PassLok.</p>
