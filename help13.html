<h3>Verify PassLok's integrity </h3>
</div>
<div id="a16" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p>1. Load PassLok from the Web, or from storage (local or cloud) if previously saved as html as described in step 4 below.</p>
<p>2. Direct your browser to &quot;view source&quot;. Each
  browser does this differently, but most non-mobile browsers have this capability. Typically, you load the source on a separate tab by typing CTRL-u (Windows) or option-cmd-u (OSX). On
  the page displaying the source, select all (CTRL-a or cmd-a), then copy to clipboard (CTRL-c or cmd-c). Alternatively, you can get the source from PassLok's GitHub repository at: <a href="https://github.com/fruiz500/passlok">https://github.com/fruiz500/passlok</a></p>
<p>3. Back in the PassLok page, make sure box 2 is clear, then paste the clipboard into it (CTRL-v or cmd-v). Click the ID
  button. The self-ID will be displayed in box 2, replacing the previous contents.</p>
<p>4. For better security, you can do a SHA256 of the source code using an external program or online utility. In this case you may need to paste the clipboard into a text or html editor so you can save it as a file (html or txt). <strong>DO NOT save the code using the "save" command from the browser menu</strong>, since this command tends to modify the source page before it saves it. A copy of PassLok saved this way will still run, but its SHA256 will be different. If your operating system is Windows, do not use the built-in Notepad program, since it cannot save text with the appropriate encoding (UTF-8, no BOM). Be sure there are no extra spaces at top and bottom, since this would affect the result. Then obtain the SHA256 of this file using the external utility.</p>
<p>5. Come back to this Help page and look at the ID for this version of PassLok, shown below. If this ID and the one obtained in step 3 or 4 are the
same, the program has not been tampered with.</p>Current version of PassLok is: 1.3.03</p>

<p>1. Start typing in box 1. As you type, a text below box 1 will tell you
  how strong the Key is, based on simple rules. If you want to see what you
  are typing and don't mind people peering over your shoulder, check the
  Show checkbox.</p>
<p>2. The Key will be stronger if it contains <strong>caPiTals</strong> in unusual places,
  <strong>numb3rs</strong>, and <strong>$ymbol$</strong>. If you use common words, <strong>mispelll</strong> them to make harder a "dictionary attack." Avoid things that refer to yourself and your family, such
  as birthdays or nicknames, or anything else that might be easy to guess,
  like: asdfg, qwerty, password, PassLok, and the like. It is a good practice to <strong>append
  your email address</strong> at the end of the Key, to combat the "rainbow table" attack. The strength meter won't give a Perfect rating unless you do so. Alternatively, you can use anything that is not a standard dictionary word instead of your email, but you must remember it.</p>
<p>3. Bear in mind, however, that you should be able to <strong>remember
  your Key</strong> without having to write it down. PassLok will never
  ask you to change your Key, so this your chance to make a truly strong Key
  that you will use for a long time.</p></div>

<h2>PassLok in one minute</h2>
</div>
<div id="a17" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p>PassLok is a privacy app conceived under the following principles:</p>
<p>1. Absolutely nothing should be installed or even written in the device. Users should be able to use a public computer or borrow someone else's smartphone, and leave no traces behind.</p>
<p>2. Completely self-contained so it runs offline. No servers.</p>
<p>3. Highest-level security at every step. No compromises.</p>
<p>4. Easy to understand and use by novices. Single-screen graphical interface, as clean and simple as possible. No cryptographic jargon.</p>
    <p>The metaphor underneath PassLok is that of locks: if you want something to be accessible only to certain people, you put a lock on it. PassLok allows you to put a lock on information in the form of text, so that when it is locked it appears to be gibberish. It also allows you to unlock it and return it to its original readable form.</p>
    <p>There are two kinds of locks out there: combination locks, and regular key locks. A combination lock can be opened by those who know the special code or combination. A regular key lock can be closed by anybody, but you need the key that matches the lock in order to open it. PassLok understands both kinds.</p>
    <p>You can lock a text with a combination, which we will call from now on a <strong>shared Key</strong>, which you give to those who are supposed to open the text, but keep secret from those whom you don&rsquo;t want to be able to read it. To do this, place the <strong>shared Key in box 1</strong> of the PassLok page and the <strong>text in box 2</strong>. Then click <strong>Lock/Unlock</strong>. To unlock a locked text, place it in box 2 and the shared Key in box 1, then click Lock/Unlock.</p>
    <p>You can also lock a text with <strong>somebody&rsquo;s Lock</strong>, which you have gotten from that person (more on this below), and then only that person will be able to open it, using his/her secret Key. To lock a text this way, place the <strong>person&rsquo;s Lock in box 1</strong> and the <strong>text in box 2</strong>. Then click <strong>Lock/Unlock</strong>. To unlock a text locked in this way, the recipient will need to place his/her Key in box 1, the locked text in box 2, and then click Lock/Unlock.</p>
<p>Combinations and Keys are secret items, but Locks are not. In PassLok, you start with a Key and then you make the Lock to match your Key. To do this, you place the <strong>Key in box 1</strong> and then click <strong>Lock/Unlock</strong> with box 2 empty. The Lock appears in box 2. <strong>You should give your Lock to people</strong> whom you wish to send you locked messages, as you would give them your phone number or your email address. It is prety much impossible to retrieve the Key from the Lock. For convenience, there is an Email button, so that you only need to supply the addresses where the Lock should be sent.</p>
  <p>PassLok has two more locking modes, which are described below, along with signatures and hidden messages. Read on if you want to learn about those.</p></div>

  <h2>PassLok lesson 2</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="a18" class="texter" style="display: none;">
<p> In PassLok, a Key is like a
      password that you type. The algorithms used in PassLok are the strongest
      known at this time (256-bit AES for encryption, and the 521-bit NIST elliptic curve for public key functions), so this means that <strong>the weak link in the
        chain is your personal or shared Key</strong>. PassLok helps you to make
      a strong Key but does not force you to compose it in any
      particular way so you can actually <strong>remember it without having to write it
      down</strong> anywhere. If you want a more sophisticated indicator of how
	  good your Key is, you may want to spend some time with <a href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/" target="_blank">ZXCVBN</a>.</p>
<p>Hackers will try to guess the Key, and you will make their
      work easier if you choose common words and/or numbers that are associated
      with you (such as a birthday, etc.) or are easy to guess for some reason.
      Using capitals in addition to small letters (not just the initial letter)
      forces them to try any combination of both types, which multiplies their
      work. Their work is also increased manifold if you throw in stuff that is
      not letters: numbers, punctuation signs, special characters. Then they'll
      have to guess from a much larger pool of possible keys. A final touch is
      using words that are misspelled, so it's hard to find them in a
      dictionary. For extra security against "rainbow tables," add your email at the end.
      PassLok rewards those using strong passwords by reducing the processing time required to use them.</p>
<p>In addition to key-locking and regular locking, PassLok
      has a third locking mode,
      triggered when neither Key nor Lock is supplied in box 1 prior to clicking the Lock/Unlock
      button. In this case, PassLok asks for a Password that is to be the same
      to lock and unlock, as in key-locking. The difference is that the
      locked message is guaranteed to fit within the 160 character limit of a
      cellular text message.</p>      
    <p>PassLok can also put a <strong>personal Stamp</strong> on a text written
      in box 2, by supplying a personal Key in box 1 and clicking the Stamp/Verify/ID
      button. The Stamp, which should be sent along with the plain text, will
      be appended at the end of the text. To verify a Stamp, people will place the text that
      allegedly was signed, including the Stamp at the end, into box 2, and the signer's Lock
      (matching the key used for stamping) in box 1, then click Stamp/Verify. A popup
      will say whether or not the Stamp verification has succeeded.</p>
<p>It is possible to authenticate a locked message without signing it. To do this,
lock it with the shared Key that results from merging your personal Key and the recipient's
Lock. Just put your Key in box 1 and the Lock in box 2, then click Make Lock, 
and then write the message into box 2 amd click Lock/Unlock or Email. The recipient will place
 his/her Key in box 1 and your Lock in box 2
in order to retrieve the shared Key, prior to placing the locked message in box 2.
<p>Finally, PassLok is able to hide a second, <strong>undetectable message</strong>
      in all the four types of locked message, plus Stamps. This could come in handy in the
      event that someone is forced to turn in his/her secret Key. To enable
      this, click on the Decoy mode checkbox below box 2. Locking,
      unlocking, and Stamp verification are the same as in the regular mode, except that popups appear requesting first
      the Password to lock the hidden message (an empty Password is okay), and then the hidden
      message itself. </p></div>
